long_name: Insert bits in 64-bit higher part (Register)
description: |
  Insertion of a subset of bits from `xs1` into `xd`.
  Instruction intended for insertion bits into bitfield within 64-bits,
  when bitfield crosses 32-bit bundary.
  Lower part of 64-bit destination is inserted using QC32.INSB,
  higher part using QC32.INSBH.
  The width of the subset is determined by (`width_minus1` + 1) (1..32),
  and the offset of the subset is determined by `shamt`.
  In case when width + offset < 33, the destination register is left unchanged.
