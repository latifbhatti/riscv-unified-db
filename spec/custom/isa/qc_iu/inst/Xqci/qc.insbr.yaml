long_name: Insert bits (Register)
description: |
  Insertion of a subset of bits from `xs1` into `xd`.
  The width of the subset is determined by `xs2` bits [21:16] (0..32),
  and the offset of the subset is determined by `xs2` bits [4:0].
  In case when width == 0, the destination register is left unchanged.
  In case when `xs2` bit [21] == 1 width is enforced to 32.
