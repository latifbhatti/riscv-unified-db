long_name: Extract bits from pair signed, packed descriptor (Register)
description: |
  Extract a subset of bits from the register pair [`xs1`, `xs1`+1] into `xd`, and sign extend the result.
  The width of the subset is determined by `xs2` bits [13:8] (0..32),
  and the offset of the subset is determined by `xs2` bits [5:0] (0..63).
  In case when `xs2` bit [13] == 1 width is enforced to 32.
  In case when width == 0, to the destination register written 0.
