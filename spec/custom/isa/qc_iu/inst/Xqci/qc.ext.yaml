long_name: Extract bits signed
description: |
  Extract a subset of bits from `xs1` into `xd`, and sign-extend the result.
  The width of the subset is determined by (`width_minus1` + 1) (1..32),
  and the offset of the subset is determined by `shamt`.
  Instruction encoded in I instruction format.
